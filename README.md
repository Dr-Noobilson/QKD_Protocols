## Summary:

- Introduction to Classical Cryptography: RSA, Symmetric, Assymetric, etc.
- Description of Shor's Algorithm and how it broke most classical assymetric key cryptography algorithm (Complexity wise)
- Description of QKD: How it proposed a secure method of transfering the keys using symmetric key cryptography which is generally not used in classical cryptography due to the problem of sending the keys over a classical channel which is prone to interception by an eavesdropper.
- BB84: Description + Implementation: Demonstration over the intranet using python library like Flask and Qiskit.
- E91: Description + Implementation: Demonstration over the intranet using python library like Flask and Qiskit.
